# Learning Kubernetes - Tech Byte Tips Youtube Series

In this YouTube video series, we will be covering the Kubernetes open source container management and orchestration platform.  The core concepts and examples that will serve you to use Kubernetes, practically.

## Approach
The point of this series is to expose a person, with no experience in Kubernetes, to as many concepts as possible and to go through lab exercises to familiarize the person and to gain experience in it.

## Goal
My goal is that by the end of the series, you've gained enough experience to use Kubernetes at work or for personal projects.

## Video Content
All of the video content for this series will be in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@techbytetips/videos).
